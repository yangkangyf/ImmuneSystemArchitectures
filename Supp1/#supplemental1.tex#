\section*{Golden Standard properties}

The Golden Standard Group ($\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$) is composed with sequences 
that belong from $5$ species of insects (\textsl{Nasonia vitripennis}, 
\textsl{Apis mellifera}, \textsl{Drosophila melanogaster}, \textsl{Anopheles 
  gambiae} and \textsl{Acyrthosiphon pisum}), mouse and human, where annotations of the
immune system was identified and retrieved. All the detailed 
steps to retrieve the immune system annotated sequences are described on the 
main text. Table \ref{tab:start} describes the number of sequences that have 
been annotated in the immune system databases: \texttt{ImmuneDB} AND 
\texttt{Insect Innate Immunity Database} (IIID). At the same time, complete 
annotation from those species have been reported in order to compare the 
percentage of proteins that are currently annotated as Immune System proteins. 
Mainly, most of the proteins inside ($\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$) 
belongs from human ($84.74$ \%) and mouse ($12.51$ \%), insects in total 
reported $2.75$ \%. At the same time was possible to quantify the percentage of 
proteins that are annotated in the immune system databases (\texttt{IIID} or 
\texttt{ImmuneDB}), particulary the annotation on human is high in comparison 
to the others organisms and in insects these value is lower that $3$\%.  

\begin{table}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\caption{Number of retrieved annotated proteins related to the Immune System. 
The annotation of these proteins have been retrieved from \texttt{Ensembl}, 
including the relationship with an annotated gene. The column \textsl{Ann. 
Proteins} represents those proteins that reported domain's annotations on 
\texttt{Ensembl}.}

Along all the proteins all the domains annotation was retrieved from 
\texttt{Ensembl} and the different domain's architectures were organized to 
define $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$ set. The arrangement of those protein domain 
architecures was performed independently for each annotation database 
(\texttt{Gene3d}, \texttt{PANTHER}, \texttt{Pfam},  \texttt{PIRSF}, 
\texttt{PRINTS}, \texttt{Prosite}, \texttt{SMART}, \texttt{SUPERFAMILY} and 
\texttt{TIGRFAM}) and \textsl{reduction system} (described at the main text) 
were applied. The initial distribution of protein's domains was necessary to 
access for the most common proteins annotated in $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$, 
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:groups}. The distribution of domains along 
$\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$ proteins reported along all the protein databases 
that the biggest number of domains comes from proteins that have been annotated 
on human and along all the species the 75 \% of the distribution reported $2$ 
domains. At the same time, $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$ also reported different 
distributions along the specific protein databases, in this case in the 
database \texttt{SMART} were reported the greatest number of domains inside a 
protein ($152$) and also the database \texttt{Prosite} reported similar 
distributions. In overall, is $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$ possible to 
characterize the greatest number of domains, as an example in Table 
\ref{tab:greatestPfamComplete} is described the proteins that have the 
greatest number of domains, annotated with the \texttt{Pfam} database for each 
of the Gold Standard species. As expected, the correspondend annotation in 
\texttt{Ensembl} database is related (when are avaliable) 
with the immune system and the distribution of domains changes when the 
reduction has been applied to generate domain architectures. In this case, the 
number of maximum domains have been reduced in all species, but at the same 
time, the most frequent domain are related with the immune system.

In order to study the $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$ architectures, was performed 
an analysis to obtain the most common architectures along all the 
Golden Standard species. In Figure \ref{fig:groups_arch} are described this 
analysis, where all the data was plotted independently for each database. The 
distribution of the protein architectures shown that the most common protein 
architectures have only one protein domains and those that reported the highest 
number of domains have a lower distribution.
