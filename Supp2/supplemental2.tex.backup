\section*{Golden Standard properties}

Golden Standard Group ($\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$) is composed with immune 
system sequences annotated in immune-specific databases (Insect Innate Immunity 
Database (IIID) and ImmuneDB). From the first one have been retrieved sequences 
from $5$ species of insects: (\textsl{Nasonia vitripennis}, \textsl{Apis 
mellifera}, \textsl{Drosophila melanogaster}, \textsl{Anopheles gambiae} and 
\textsl{Acyrthosiphon pisum}). For the second one,  additional sequences from 
mouse and human. All the detailed steps to retrieve the immune system sequences 
are described on the main text. Table \ref{tab:start} describes the number of 
sequences that have been annotated in those immune system databases. At the same 
time, complete annotation from the latter species have been retrieved from 
\texttt{Ensembl} in order to compare the percentage of proteins that are 
annotated as Immune System proteins by the referenced databases. 

First, all the reported proteins along the immune-system databases represented 
less than $3$\% of annotated proteins in insect, while in mouse $\sim 9.32$\% 
and particularly in human a $\sim 36.90$\%. Also, the number of proteins that 
belong from human are the most frequent in $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$, where 
represent a $84.74$\% followed by mouse sequences ($12.51$\%), while insects in 
total reported $2.75$\%.

(\texttt{ImmuneDB} or \texttt{IIID}).}

Annotation for the sequences and protein domains was retrieved from 
\texttt{Ensembl}, that constituted the starting data to define 
$\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$.  

Definition for \textit{domains} along all the protein 
databases (i.e  \texttt{Gene3d}, \texttt{PANTHER}, \texttt{Pfam}, 
\texttt{PIRSF}, \texttt{PRINTS}, \texttt{Prosite}, 
\texttt{SMART}, \texttt{SUPERFAMILY} and \texttt{TIGRFAM}), are not the same. 
In overall, Figure \ref{fig:groups} shows the frequency distribution of the 
number of protein domains inside proteins along the different annotation 
databases. In this case, annotations from different databases were analyzed 
independently. At the same time, two different groups were plotted: Complete and 
Reduced. The first one refers to the original annotation for each protein in 
Ensembl. In the second one are described the same proteins but, after 
performing the reduction of redundancy of domains in the protein's architecture 
(see Methods). 

The distribution of domains along $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$ 
reported in all the protein databases that most of the domains comes from 
proteins that have been annotated on human (blue dots). Additionally, the 
distribution of domains along all the proteins shown that $75$\% of all proteins 
reported architectures with $\leq 2$ domains. At the same time, 
$\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$ also reported different distributions along the 
specific protein databases, in this case \texttt{SMART} reported the greatest 
number of domains inside a protein ($152$) and also, \texttt{Prosite} 
reported similar distributions. 

As an example, Table \ref{tab:greatestPfamComplete} list the proteins that 
have the biggest number of annotated domains, in this case with \texttt{Pfam} 
along all the Gold Standard species. As expected, the annotation 
for the protein domains retrieved from \texttt{Ensembl} is related (when are 
available) with the immune system. The annotation in general are related with 
detection proteins (i.e transmembrane receptors) or recognition of specific 
patterns, as Lectins or directly Immunoglobulin domains.

When the protein's architectures in $\boldsymbol{\mathfrak{G}}$ were analyzed 
along all the species and the distribution of domains were calculated. The 
complete result is shown in Figure \ref{fig:groups_arch}, where 
all the information were analyzed independently by protein database and the 
distribution of protein architectures was calculated and its relation with the 
domain number. In this analysis were taken into account the number of 
architectures from $1$ because this set contains those proteins that 
possibly reported repetitions for the same domain and were collapsed after the 
reduction step. In this set of $1$ domain, is posible to identify architectures 
that have been detected in a wide range of proteins along the annotation of the 
Golden Standard species; this pattern was detected for all the databases and 
also reported architectures that have been present in more than $1832$ 
proteins, as seen for the Immunoglobulins domain (Accession number: 
\texttt{2.60.40.10}). As shown in Figure \ref{fig:immunoglob}, this domain has 
been annotated in all of the species in \texttt{Ensembl} as: Immunoglobulin-like 
or Immunoglobulin-like-fold for the Gene3d database. Also, this region has 
another annotations for the same region by others protein domain databases, 
even including another protein domains and consequently generating another 
protein architectures. 

In general larger numbers in protein domains are not frequent in proteins in 
comparison to the lower ones, as seen when the range of the data is compared 
and also, supporting the pattern observed on Figure \ref{fig:groups}.
