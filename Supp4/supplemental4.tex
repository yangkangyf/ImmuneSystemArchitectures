\maketitle

\section*{Didemnum vexillum re-annotation}
\subsection*{Annotation of coding regions with \texttt{Augustus}}
\subsection*{Mapping previous ncRNA annnotation on new assembly}
Previous ncRNA annotation was retrieved from Velandia-Huerto, \textit{et al} \cite{} 
in fasta format. All the contigs which have been reported an ncRNA have been obtained
from the first reported assembly of the \textit{D.\ vexillum} 
genome\footnote{\url{http://tunicata.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Download.html}}. This
multifasta file was mapped onto the new genome with \texttt{blast}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, breaklines=true]
blastall -p blastb -d <DB> -i <QUERY> -F F -e 10e-5 -m 8 -o <OUT>
\end{lstlisting}

Aligment files were retrieved in \texttt{maf} format and were parsed
with \texttt{Bio::AlignIO} \texttt{Bioperl} library. The criteria to
obtain the best genome coordinates was choosen based on the relation
between the length of the mapped region into the new genome ($m$) and
the original size of the query contig in the old genome ($s$). The
relation was defined as $R = \frac{m}{s}$, and were defined as the best 
mapping candidates those ones reported $R = 1$, but in order to retrieve
the maximum number of mapping between the two genome versions, $R \geq 0.90$
was also considered.

From $247$ contigs, was possible to map $212$ in the raw results after the 
mapping stage with $lastz$. After considering the $R$ relation, those results
were parsed, resulting in: $64$ ($R = 1$), $35$ ($0.95 \leq R < 1 $), 
$39$ ($0.90 \leq R < 0.95$) and $39$ ($0.85 \leq R < 0.90$). Best candidates
was choosen based on the final aligment score. For those contigs that 
reported 1:many relations, those set of positions in the new assembly was 
also considered in the following analysis.


According to the set of blast parameters the number of contigs were increasing
into the new genome. At the same time, if one contig reported more than one
candidates into the new genome, was choosen this/those one (s) that reported the 
highest bitscore. Having this previous information as an additional source of 
information in order to clean the true position of the annotated ncRNAs in the
new genomes. After mapping all the candidates with \texttt{blast}, the true locations
were obtained after applying those filters:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Identity have to be $\geq 85$\%.
 \item E-value $\leq 10^{-10}$.
 \item Relation of sizes between the homology region of the query
  ($r_h$) and their calculated size ($r_s$) have to be $\frac{r_h}{r_s} \geq 0.9$
\end{itemize}

From the $264$ reported loci of ncRNAs, XY were retrieved in the
new genome, \texttt{GFF} file is reported along with all the coding and non-coding
regions on Supplemental File X.
